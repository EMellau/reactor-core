/**
 * A {@link CoreSubscriber} that can be attached to any {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} to later assert which
 * events occurred at runtime. This can be used as an alternative to {@link reactor.test.StepVerifier}
 * for more complex scenarios, e.g. more than one possible outcome, racing...
 * <p>
 * The subscriber can be fine tuned with a {@link #builder()}, which also allows to produce a {@link reactor.core.Fuseable.ConditionalSubscriber}
 * variant if needed.
 * <p>
 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber}-inherited methods never throw, but a few failure conditions might be met, which
 * fall into two categories.
 * <p>
 * The first category are "protocol errors": when the occurrence of an incoming signal doesn't follow the Reactive Streams
 * specification. The case must be covered explicitly in the specification, and leads to the signal being added to the
 * {@link #getProtocolErrors()} list. All protocol errors imply that the {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} has terminated
 * already. The list of detected protocol errors is:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the {@link TestSubscriber} has already terminated (onComplete or onError), but an {@link #onNext(Object)} is received: onNext signal added to protocol errors</li>
 *     <li>the {@link TestSubscriber} has already terminated, but an {@link #onComplete()} is received: onComplete signal added to protocol errors</li>
 *     <li>the {@link TestSubscriber} has already terminated, but an {@link #onError(Throwable)} is received: onError signal added to protocol errors</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The second category are "subscription failures", which are the only ones for which {@link TestSubscriber} internally performs an assertion.
 * These failure conditions always lead to a cancellation of the subscription and are represented as an {@link AssertionError}.
 * The assertion error is thrown by all the {@link #getReceivedOnNext() getXxx} and {@link #isTerminated() isXxx} accessors, the {@link #block()} methods
 * and the {@link #expectTerminalError()}/{@link #expectTerminalSignal()} methods. The possible subscription failures are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the {@link TestSubscriber} has already received a {@link Subscription} (ie. it is being reused). Both subscriptions are cancelled.</li>
 *     <li>the incoming {@link Subscription} is not capable of fusion, but fusion was required by the user</li>
 *     <li>the incoming {@link Subscription} is capable of fusion, but this was forbidden by the user</li>
 *     <li>the incoming {@link Subscription} is capable of fusion, but the negotiated fusion mode is not the one required by the user</li>
 *     <li>onNext(null) is received, which should denote ASYNC fusion, but ASYNC fusion hasn't been established</li>
 * </ul>
